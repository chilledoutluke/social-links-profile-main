## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I have learnt that if you start slow, going from start to bottom. Adding all the necessary tags, classes and IDs it can make a wolrd of difference when styling. Especially if you comment every new section you are working, you are able to keep track of where you and what you need to do next. 

The importances of writing concise commits in your github repositories when practicing will allow you to create a habit so that when i work with a team, it will be easy to implement that in my version control.

The importance of knowing your stuff but also how to solve problems when you are stuck, the more you are willing to be open to researching how to fix your problems and ask for help. The better I become as a Developer over time.


### Continued development

I'd like to continue focusing on building my portfolio and showcasing my skills development as i get better at coding. I definitely want to start incorporating JS into my code now that I am feeling more comfortable working on projects. But I will continue to work on my CSS and HTML along the way to better improve my clean code goals.
